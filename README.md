## Serial Manipulator (6 dof) Kinematics 

In this project, we provide direct and inverse kinematics implementation for a 6 serial manipulator with 6 degrees-of-freedom (dof). This implementation was attained using homogeneous matrix transformations to represent positions and orientations of the rigid bodies forming the robot.

The file ***final_report.pdf*** provides an extensive and detailed description of our approach.

### Code:

The serial manipulator kinematics implementation in MATLAB can be found in the following files:

+ ***d_kinematics.m***: direct kinematics implementation of the 6 dof serial manipulator;
+ ***inv_kinematics.m***: inverse kinematics implementation of the 6 dof serial manipulator.
